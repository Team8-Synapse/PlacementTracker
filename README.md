# Amrita Placement Tracker

A centralized, end-to-end campus placement management system designed to streamline and automate placement activities for students, placement coordinators, and recruiters.

---

## Overview

**Amrita Placement Tracker** is a unified web/mobile application that manages the complete placement lifecycle — from placement drive announcements and eligibility checks to application tracking, interview rounds, notifications, and analytics.

The platform replaces fragmented communication channels with a structured, transparent, and scalable system.

---

## Problem Statement

Campus placement information is currently distributed across multiple platforms such as:

- Emails  
- WhatsApp groups  
- Excel sheets  
- Physical notice boards  

This results in:

- Missed deadlines  
- Confusion regarding eligibility  
- No clear visibility of application status  
- High manual workload for placement coordinators  
- Increased chances of human error  

A centralized, automated solution is required to manage placements effectively.

## Proposed Solution

The Amrita Placement Tracker acts as an end-to-end placement management system that:

- Centralizes all placement-related information  
- Automates eligibility verification  
- Tracks student progress across recruitment rounds  
- Sends real-time notifications and alerts  
- Provides analytics and reports for coordinators  

The system is designed to be scalable, modular, and role-based.
